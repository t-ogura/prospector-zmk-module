 * Board-level configuration for Seeeduino XIAO BLE (Prospector Scanner)
 * 
 * SENSOR SUPPORT REMOVED: This overlay no longer includes sensor configurations
 * to prevent Device Tree linking errors when sensors are not enabled.
 * 
 * For sensor support (APDS9960), users must:
 * 1. Enable CONFIG_PROSPECTOR_USE_AMBIENT_LIGHT_SENSOR=y
 * 2. Enable CONFIG_APDS9960=y 
 * 3. Add custom overlay with I2C and sensor Device Tree nodes
 * 
 * This change ensures v1.1.1 boots safely on all hardware configurations.
